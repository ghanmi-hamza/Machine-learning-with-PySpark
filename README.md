# Machine learning Using Pyspark

##### This is a helpful notebook which contains:
- Creating a Spark application.
- Using Spark sql for manipulating the dataframe
- Using data processing steps (feature encoding, scaling, selection ...)
- Training and Testing ml-models

##### In This notebook I tested almost machine learning algorithms:

- DECISION TREE
- Deep Learning Multilayer Perceptron
- NAIVE BAYES
- LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- One-vs-Rest 
- RANDOM FOREST

Note that this notebook was made in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) so you don't need to install any package just run cells in google colab +  I used keystroke data and Touch data 



**Helpful notebook, Yeah!**
