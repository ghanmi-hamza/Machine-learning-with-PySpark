#### Basic Needs Basic Rights Kenya - Tech4MentalHealth
#### This is a  competition from ZINDI Plateform.

The aim of the competition is to:
- develop a machine learning model that classifies statements and questions expressed by university students in Kenya when  peaking about the mental health challenges they struggle with. The four categories are depression, suicide, alchoholism, and drug abuse.
- The evaluation metric for this challenge is Log Loss

In This notebook I tested almost machine learning algorithms:
- SVM
- SGD
- XGBOOST
- NAIVE BAYES
- LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- ADABOOST
- RANDOM FOREST
- ...

##### My best result:
- log loss = 0.460
